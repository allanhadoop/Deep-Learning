# Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
# Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors),
 

# In Python, scikit-learn is a widely used library for implementing machine learning algorithms,
# Tuning parameters value for machine learning algorithms effectively improves the model performance. 
# Let’s look at the list of parameters available with SVM. Basically "kernel”, “gamma” and “C” these parameters has higher impact on model
# For Kernel - there are 3 options - “linear”, “rbf”,”poly” and others (default value is “rbf”).  Here “rbf” and “poly” are useful for non-linear hyper-plane. L

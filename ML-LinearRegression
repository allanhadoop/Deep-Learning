The process of determining the relationship between two variables is called as regression.
#Source - http://math.tutorvista.com/statistics/regression.html
Y (line/bar or overscore on Y ) is mean value of Y.

Python example
# http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py
# Code to show how linear regression attempts to draw a straight line that will best minimize the residual sum of squares between 
# the observed responses in the dataset, and the responses predicted by the linear approximation.
# The coefficients, the residual sum of squares and the variance score are also calculated.

X - is features ( or called data attributes) 
y - labels ( predictions )

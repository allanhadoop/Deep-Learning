# Keras is a powerful easy-to-use Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.
It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train 
neural network models in a few short lines of code.

1  Load Data.
2. Define Model.
3. Compile Model.
4. Fit Model.
5. Evaluate Model.
6. Tie It All Together.

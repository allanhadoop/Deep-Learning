ANN - Artifical Neural Network 
BPNN - Back Propogration(of error) Neural Network 

# Speed and Momementum is important 

##AWS AMI ready with software, it runs on P2 instance - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB#product-description
Or optionally, install software based on - http://ramhiser.com/2016/01/05/installing-tensorflow-on-an-aws-ec2-instance-with-gpu-support/

# A neural network trained with backpropagation is attempting to use input to predict output.Backpropagation, in its simplest form, measures statistics
like this to make a model. see below example - Consider trying to predict the output column given the three input columns. We could solve this problem
by simply measuring statistics between the input values and the output values

Input -- output 
0 0 1 -- 0
1 1 1 -- 1
1 0 1 -- 1
0 1 1 -- 0 

PYTHON numpy package - adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
